Weekly Forecasts of wind speed and temparature in Berlin-Tempelhof and DAX Returns

Models are implemented in model_< variable >.R files. 
the model_enhancement.R file should be seen as a gigantic notebook containing all exploration and analyses i have done. 
Eversthing worth getting a function for is in the corresponding .R-file, like visual_checks.R for visualization and so on.
The forecasts themselves are made in make_forecasts.R. Note that the weather data has to be downloaded manually beforehand!
